The advent of the various large-scale genomics data especially The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) facilitates the systematic characterization of cancer driver genes in Pan-Cancer analysis. To integrate available orthogonal datasets from diverse resources, an efficient approach that unbiasedly incorporates various types of features is still needed. Although other existing methods can also identify cancer driver genes, they cannot identify TSGs and OGs separately. The collection of features in previous approaches is typically limited and does not fully utilize genomic and epigenetic features that have been shown to effectively identify cancer driver genes in the past few years. To meet that need, we propose the tool DORGE (pronounce as dodge): Discovery of Oncogenes and Tumor SuppressoR Genes, a comprehensive machine-learning framework to discover cancer driver genes by integrating genetic and epigenetic data in a pan-cancer analysis.

Using the website, you can identify the cancer driver genes (TSGs and OGs) based on a confident machine-learning algorithm: Elastic net. You can also further identify the cancer driver genes that express in certain cell lines or tissues. The default gene table (DORGE prediction table) provides a convinent cancer driver gene list with TSG or OG role. The gene-specific search offers the H3K4me3 peak information for genes with broad H3K4me3 peaks and gene-body hypermethylation information for gene-body canyon genes.
